![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rock3r/smartlock-demo/master/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

This repo contains a simple yet fully functional username/password screen that uses
[Smart Lock for Passwords](https://developers.google.com/identity/smartlock-passwords/android/) to simplify the process of logging in.

Please note that this example focuses on the username and password credentials flow, and doesn't use the federated login capabilities of the API.
